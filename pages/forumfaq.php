    To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies on your device. Most big websites do this too.</td></tr>

    <h4>What are cookies?</h4>
    A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you do not have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another. </td></tr>

<tr class="cell0"><td>
    <h4>How do we use cookies?</h4>
    Blargboard uses a cookie to manage your login session. It stores a random, 16-character-long alphanumeric string in your browser to ensure that your login session will be connected to your browser only, and not to anyone else\'s.
    These are the only cookies our site uses.</td></tr>

<tr class="cell1"><td>
    <h4>How to control cookies</h4>
    You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish – for details, see <a href="http://aboutcookies.org/">aboutcookies.org</a>. You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.

        By registering a user account, you will be able to post on the board as well as use several features only accessible through registering, such as the ability to mark forums as read and private messaging. Unregistered users have guest access to the board, meaning they can view threads but not reply to them. They can also only see the board in whatever theme is the default.

        What can I do about my thread being either closed, trashed, or deleted?</th></tr>
<tr class="cell0"><td>
        First off, do not complain about this issue on the board about a thread being closed or deleted, and do not single out a certain mod or admin as being responsible. This will result in a ban. Learn from your mistakes and move on.<br><br>

If you feel you need clarification on why the thread was closed, or if you feel a mistake was made, contact a staff member, preferably a local moderator who iss in charge of the relevant forum, and politely explain the problem.

    <h4>How do I add my EXP and post counters to my signature or post?</h4></th></tr>

Sorry, but you cannot add those features to your signature or post as this board software does not have things like Levels, experience or item shops, unlike the AcmlmBoard software it is based on.

    <h4>How do I get a custom title?</h4></th></tr>
<tr class="cell0"><td>
Custom titles are titles you can use in addition to, or in place of the ranks provided by the board. There are three ways to get them:<br><br>

1. After 100 posts, or if you have been around 2 months you will need 50.<br>
2. Being a member of staff.<br><br>

The custom title is a reward for being an active member of the community. Use of the custom title to impersonate staff, or to flame members/staff may result in the loss of custom title.

    <h4>What are avatars & mood avatars?</h4></th></tr>

Avatars are a form of display picture which appears beside your posts and in your profile. Likewise, a mood avatar allows you to display a different picture as opposed to the one specified in your profile.

You unfortunately cannot edit a poll you made.
Poll editing is rather difficult to correctly implement and carries a risk of gross abuse.
Imagine if you will, that you make a poll about something, and you do not like the results. With poll editing, you could then go and switch the answers around.

'.$colortable.'

<br><br>However, if you see a color that is not in this list, it is because staff can have a custom color nickname.

        While we allow very open and customizable layouts and sidebars, we have a few rules that will be strictly enforced. Please read them over and follow them. Loss of post layout privileges will be enacted for those who are repeat offenders. If in doubt ask a member of staff. The staff has discretion in deciding violations. This list is expected to be updated regularly, so please make sure to stay up to date.

        <h4>Do not make your layout difficult to read.</h4>
        Having similar text and background colors makes it difficult to read your posts.
    </td></tr><tr class="cell1"><td>
        <h4>Do not make your layout too wild.</h4>
        This includes spamming animations or crazy colors, or causing pages to lag.
    </td></tr><tr class="cell0"><td>
        <h4>Do not put visible text in your layout header. Do not put visible text in your signature without showing the signature separator.</h4>
        Putting visible text in the header is confusing because it looks like part of your posts. This applies to signatures, too, though it is okay there if you check the "Show signature separator" box.
    </td></tr><tr class="cell1"><td>
        <h4>The maximum allowed height for signatures is 150 pixels.</h4>
        Users with signatures larger than 150px will be contacted by staff and asked to edit their signature so it fits. If they do not fix the signature within a day of being notified, the signature may be deleted.
