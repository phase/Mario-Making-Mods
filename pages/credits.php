	Hey, I\'m GRAnimated. I love modding games, but I have the most experience with Super Mario Maker. I\'ve done many stupid things in the past, and got banned from quite a few places. Below, there\'s a list of the better mods I\'ve done for SMM.

Minecraft in Super Mario Maker
Code Edits (Actually just string replacing)
Layout Edits
A lot of stuff for Mario Maker: Beta Revived

I also have a capture device for the Wii U, Xbox One, etc.
I have some experience with Java, and I know some basic web design (HTML and CSS).
Anyway, that\'s basically it!
I have a neat YouTube channel, too! (https://youtube.com/granimated)
I also have a website that you can play some retro games on with the Nesbox emulator! (http://classicmods.com/)</td></tr>
